The \_ACOS function returns the angle measured in radians based on an input [COSine](/qb64wiki/index.php/COS "COS") value ranging from -1 to 1.

## Syntax


*radian\_angle!* = \_ACOS(*cosine\_value!*)
  




## Description


* The *cosine\_value!* must be measured >= -1 and <= 1, or an error will be generated. (PRINT \_ACOS(1.2) would give the result of -1.#IND, which is basically QB64's way of telling us that the number doesn't exist, much like 1/0 would.)
* ARCCOSINE is the inverse function of [COSine](/qb64wiki/index.php/COS "COS"), which lets us turn a [COSine](/qb64wiki/index.php/COS "COS") value back into an angle.
* Note: Due to rounding with floating point math, the \_ACOS may not always give a perfect match for the COS angle which generated this. You can reduce the number of rounding errors by increasing the precision of your calculations by using [DOUBLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/DOUBLE "DOUBLE") or [\_FLOAT](/qb64wiki/index.php/FLOAT "FLOAT") precision variables instead of [SINGLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SINGLE "SINGLE").


  




## Availability


* **Version 1.000 and up.**


  




## Examples


*Example:* Converting a radian angle to its COSine and using that value to find the angle in degrees again using \_ACOS:





| ``` [DEFDBL](/qb64wiki/index.php/DEFDBL "DEFDBL") A-Z  [INPUT](/qb64wiki/index.php/INPUT "INPUT") "Give me an Angle (in Degrees) => "; Angle [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") C = [COS](/qb64wiki/index.php/COS "COS")([_D2R](/qb64wiki/index.php/D2R "D2R")(Angle)) '_D2R is the command to convert Degrees to Radians, which is what COS expects [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "The COSINE of the Angle is: "; C A = _ACOS(C) [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "The ACOS of "; C; " is: "; A [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, the value is "; [_R2D](/qb64wiki/index.php/R2D "R2D")(A)  ``` |

Example by SMcNeill


| ``` Give me an Angle (in Degrees) =>Â ? 60  The COSINE of the Angle is:  .5000000000000001 The ACOS of  .5000000000000001  is:  1.047197551196598 Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, we discover the value is  60  ``` |
