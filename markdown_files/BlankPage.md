## _BlankPage
---

### The _BlankPage serves as a skeleton for new Wiki pages.

#### SYNTAX

`_BlankSub arg1 [, arg2 ]`

#### PARAMETERS
* arg1 is a mandatory argument
* the arg2 is optional


#### DESCRIPTION


#### EXAMPLES
```vb
'Place your code example here
'The "Cl" (code link) template can be used to link keywords to its
'respective Wiki page. Those words will also get highlighted.
COLOR 15,4
PRINT "Hello World!"
```
  
```vb
Note: To avoid the annoying task of manually inserting the templates
in your code examples, since v3.7.0 you may simply write your example
in the IDE and later use the menu "File > Export As > Wiki example" to
export a completely prepared code block, which you can paste "as is"
into the Wiki page.

Oh, and by the way, this preformatted text block is also new. Generally
it's the same as a fixed text block shown above, but it uses horizontal
scrollers instead of stretching the text box and it has a more plain
appearance. If you want avoid the horizontal scroller, then restrict
yourself to a line length of max. 72 characters.
```
  
```vb
Hello World!
```
