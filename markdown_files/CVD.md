# CVD
> The CVD function decodes an 8-byte STRING generated by MKD$ (or read from a file) to DOUBLE numeric values.

## SYNTAX
`result# = CVD ( stringData$ )`

## DESCRIPTION
* CV functions ( [CVD](CVD.md) , [CVS](CVS.md) , [CVI](CVI.md) , [CVL](CVL.md) , [CVDMBF](CVDMBF.md) , [CVSMBF](CVSMBF.md) ) are used to convert values encoded by MK$ functions ( MKD$ , MKS$ , MKI$ , MKL$ , MKDMBF$ , MKSMBF$ ).
* Variables of numerical types are also encoded when [PUT](PUT.md) to a [RANDOM](RANDOM.md) or [BINARY](BINARY.md) -access file.
* QB64 has [_CV](_CV.md) and _MK$ functions which can also deal with extended data types .
* [DOUBLE](DOUBLE.md) values can range up to 15 decimal point digits. Decimal point accuracy depends on whole value places taken.


## EXAMPLES
> Example 1: Reading an 8-byte encoded string n$ from a file and obtaining the decoded DOUBLE value:

```vb
FIELD #1, 8 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1
Y# = CVD(N$)
```

> Example 2: Showcases the reduced space to store an encoded number.

```vb
FIELD #1, 8 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1
Y# = CVD(N$)
```


```vb
FIELD #1, 8 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1
Y# = CVD(N$)
```
