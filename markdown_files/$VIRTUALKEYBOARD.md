## Syntax


**$VIRTUALKEYBOARD:ON**
**$VIRTUALKEYBOARD:OFF**
  




## Description


* This metacommand did not require a comment *['](/qb64wiki/index.php/Apostrophe "Apostrophe")* or [REM](/qb64wiki/index.php/REM "REM") before it. There was no space between the metacommand name, the colon and the ON/OFF parameter.
* It placed a virtual keyboard on screen, which could be used in touch-enabled devices like Windows tablets.
* Deprecated, in all current versions of QB64 it just generates a warning now, but has no other effect anymore.


  




## Examples




| ``` $VIRTUALKEYBOARD:ON  [DO](/qb64wiki/index.php/DO "DO"): [LOOP](/qb64wiki/index.php/LOOP "LOOP") [UNTIL](/qb64wiki/index.php/UNTIL "UNTIL") [INKEY$](/qb64wiki/index.php/INKEY$ "INKEY$") = [CHR$](/qb64wiki/index.php/CHR$ "CHR$")(27)  ``` |
