## Syntax


SEEK *filenumber&*, *position*
  




## Parameters


* *filenumber&* must be the file number that is [OPEN](/qb64wiki/index.php/OPEN "OPEN") and being read or written to.
* *position* is a byte in [BINARY](/qb64wiki/index.php/BINARY "BINARY") or sequencial files created in [OUTPUT](/qb64wiki/index.php/OUTPUT "OUTPUT"), [APPEND](/qb64wiki/index.php/APPEND "APPEND") or [INPUT](/qb64wiki/index.php/INPUT_(file_mode) "INPUT (file mode)") modes. The first byte = 1.
* *position* is the record in [RANDOM](/qb64wiki/index.php/RANDOM "RANDOM") files to read or write. Records can hold more than one variable defined in a [TYPE](/qb64wiki/index.php/TYPE "TYPE").
* Since the first **SEEK** file position is 1 it may require adding one to an offset value when documentation uses that position as 0.
* After a **SEEK** statement, the next file operation starts at that **SEEK** byte position.
* The **SEEK** statement can work with the [SEEK (function)](/qb64wiki/index.php/SEEK_(function) "SEEK (function)") to move around in a file.


### Notes


* Don't confuse the [LOC](/qb64wiki/index.php/LOC "LOC") position with the [SEEK](/qb64wiki/index.php/SEEK_(function) "SEEK (function)") positionÂ !!
	+ **LOC** is the last read or written byte or record prosition.
	+ **SEEK** is the byte or record prosition to read or write next.


  




## Examples


Example 1
A **SEEK** statement using the [SEEK (function)](/qb64wiki/index.php/SEEK_(function) "SEEK (function)") to move to the next random record in a file.


| ``` SEEK 1, [SEEK](/qb64wiki/index.php/SEEK_(function) "SEEK (function)")(1) + 1  ``` |
| --- |




---


Example 2
Demonstrate the difference between **LOC** and **SEEK** positions in a file.


| ``` OPEN "readme.md" FOR BINARY AS #1  PRINT LOC(1) 'LOC returns 0, as we didn't read something yet PRINT SEEK(1) 'SEEK otherwise returns 1, as it's the first byte to read  GET #1, , a& 'now let's read a LONG (4 bytes)  PRINT LOC(1) 'now LOC returns 4, the last read byte PRINT SEEK(1) 'and SEEK returns 5 now, the next byte to read  CLOSE #1 END  ``` |
| --- |




| ``` 0 1 4 5  ``` |
| --- |
