## Screen Saver Programs
---

### Screen savers are simply graphics EXE programs renamed with the SCR file extension. The program should NOT use a lot of Window's CPU resources! To check the CPU usage, open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys and look for the QB64 program running in the Processes tab list. CPU usage should be less than 50% and ideally less than 20%. Use _LIMIT or SLEEP when needed.
