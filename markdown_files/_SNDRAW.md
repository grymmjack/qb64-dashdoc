## Syntax


\_SNDRAW *leftSample*[, *rightSample*][, *pipeHandle&*]
  




## Parameters


* The *leftSample* and *rightSample* value(s) can be any [SINGLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SINGLE "SINGLE") or [DOUBLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/DOUBLE "DOUBLE") literal or variable frequency value from -1.0 to 1.0.
* The *pipeHandle&* parameter refers to the sound pipe opened using [\_SNDOPENRAW](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDOPENRAW "SNDOPENRAW").


  




## Description


* Specifying *pipeHandle&* allows sound to be played through two or more channels at the same time (**version 1.000 and up**).
* If only *leftSample* value is used, the sound will come out of both speakers.
* Using \_SNDRAW will pause any currently playing music.
* \_SNDRAW is designed for continuous play. It will not produce any sound until a significant number of samples have been queued. No sound is played if only a few samples are queued.
* Ensure that [\_SNDRAWLEN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRAWLEN "SNDRAWLEN") is comfortably above 0 (until you've actually finished playing sound). If you are getting occasional unintended random clicks, this generally means that [\_SNDRAWLEN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRAWLEN "SNDRAWLEN") has dropped to 0.
* \_SNDRAW is not intended to queue up many minutes worth of sound. It will probably work but will chew up a lot of memory (and if it gets swapped to disk, your sound could be interrupted abruptly).
* [\_SNDRATE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRATE "SNDRATE") determines how many samples are played per second, but timing is done by the sound card, not your program.
* **Do not attempt to use [\_TIMER](/qb64wiki/index.php/TIMER "TIMER") or [\_DELAY](/qb64wiki/index.php/DELAY "DELAY") or [\_LIMIT](/qb64wiki/index.php/LIMIT "LIMIT") to control the timing of \_SNDRAW. You may use them for delays or to limit your program's CPU usage, but how much to queue should only be based on the [\_SNDRAWLEN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRAWLEN "SNDRAWLEN").**


  




## Examples


*Example 1:* Sound using a sine wave with \_SNDRAW Amplitude \* SIN(8 \* ATN(1) \* Duration \* (Frequency / \_SNDRATE))





| ``` FREQ = 400                             'any frequency desired from 36 to 10,000 Pi2 = 8 * [ATN](/qb64wiki/index.php/ATN "ATN")(1)                       '2 * pi Amplitude = .3                         'amplitude of the signal from -1.0 to 1.0 SampleRate = [_SNDRATE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRATE "SNDRATE")                  'sets the sample rate FRate = FREQ / SampleRate' [FOR](/qb64wiki/index.php/FOR...NEXT "FOR...NEXT") Duration = 0 [TO](/qb64wiki/index.php/TO "TO") 5 * SampleRate     'play 5 seconds         _SNDRAW Amplitude * [SIN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN")(Pi2 * Duration * FRate)            'sine wave        '_SNDRAW Amplitude * [SGN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SGN "SGN")([SIN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN")(Pi2 * Duration * FRate))       'square wave [NEXT](/qb64wiki/index.php/NEXT "NEXT") [_SNDRAWDONE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRAWDONE "SNDRAWDONE") [DO](/qb64wiki/index.php/DO "DO"): LOOP [WHILE](/qb64wiki/index.php/WHILE "WHILE") [_SNDRAWLEN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRAWLEN "SNDRAWLEN") [END](/qb64wiki/index.php/END "END")  ``` |

*Explanation:* The loop Duration is determined by the number of seconds times the [\_SNDRATE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SNDRATE "SNDRATE") number of samples per second. Square waves can use the same formula with Amplitude \* [SGN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SGN "SGN")(SIN(8 \* ATN(1) \* Duration \* (Frequency/\_SNDRATE))).
  

*Example 2:* A simple ringing bell tone that tapers off.

*Example 3:* Routine uses \_SNDRAW to display and play 12 notes from octaves 1 through 9.
