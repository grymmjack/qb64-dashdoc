The \_ASIN function returns the angle measured in radians based on an input [SINe](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN") value ranging from -1 to 1.

## Syntax


*radian\_angle!* = \_ASIN(*sine\_value!*)
  




## Description


* The *sine\_value!* must be measured >= -1 and <= 1, or else it will generate a return value of **-1.#IND**, which is basically QB64's way of telling us that the number doesn't exist.
* ARCSINE is the inverse function of [SINe](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN"), and turns a [SINe](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN") value back into an angle.
* Note: Due to rounding with floating point math, the \_ASIN may not always give a perfect match for the [SIN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN") angle which generated this. You can reduce the number of rounding errors by increasing the precision of your calculations by using [DOUBLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/DOUBLE "DOUBLE") or [\_FLOAT](/qb64wiki/index.php/FLOAT "FLOAT") precision variables instead of [SINGLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SINGLE "SINGLE").


  




## Availability


* **Version 1.000 and up**


  




## Examples


*Example:* Converting a radian angle to its SINe and using that value to find the angle in degrees again using \_ASIN:





| ``` [DEFDBL](/qb64wiki/index.php/DEFDBL "DEFDBL") A-Z  [INPUT](/qb64wiki/index.php/INPUT "INPUT") "Give me an Angle (in Degrees) => "; Angle [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") C = [SIN](/qb64wiki/index.php/SIN "SIN")([_D2R](/qb64wiki/index.php/D2R "D2R")(Angle)) '_D2R is the command to convert Degrees to Radians, which is what SIN expects [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "The SINE of the Angle is: "; C A = _ASIN(C) [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "The ASIN of "; C; " is: "; A [PRINT](/qb64wiki/index.php/PRINT "PRINT") "Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, the value is "; [_R2D](/qb64wiki/index.php/R2D "R2D")(A)  ``` |

Example by SMcNeill


| ``` Give me an Angle (in Degrees) =>Â ? 60  The SINE of the Angle is:  .8660254037844386 The ACOS of   .8660254037844386  is:   1.047197551196598 Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, we discover the value is  60  ``` |
