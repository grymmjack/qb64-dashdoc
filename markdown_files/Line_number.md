## Line number
---

### Line numbers or line labels are used in QBasic as references to code lines. Numbers are required with GOTO and numbers or label names are required with GOSUB . Although not required in QBasic, other older programming languages such as GW Basic often required them. Line labels require a colon after them to differentiate them from keywords and variable names.
