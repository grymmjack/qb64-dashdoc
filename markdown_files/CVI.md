# CVI
> The CVI function decodes a 2-byte STRING generated by MKI$ (or read from a file) to INTEGER numeric values.

## SYNTAX
`result% = CVI ( stringData$ )`

## DESCRIPTION
* CV functions ( [CVD](CVD.md) , [CVS](CVS.md) , [CVI](CVI.md) , [CVL](CVL.md) , [CVDMBF](CVDMBF.md) , [CVSMBF](CVSMBF.md) ) are used to convert values encoded by MK$ functions ( MKD$ , MKS$ , MKI$ , MKL$ , MKDMBF$ , MKSMBF$ ).
* QB64 has [_CV](_CV.md) and _MK$ functions which can also deal with extended data types .
* [INTEGER](INTEGER.md) values can range from -32768 to 32767.
* Doesn't return [_UNSIGNED](_UNSIGNED.md) values.


## EXAMPLES
> Example 1:

```vb
FIELD #1, 2 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1     'GET does not need a position or variable with successive FIELD buffer reads
Y = CVI(N$)
```

> Example 2: How CVI converts the ASCII code values created by the MKI$ function.

```vb
FIELD #1, 2 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1     'GET does not need a position or variable with successive FIELD buffer reads
Y = CVI(N$)
```


```vb
FIELD #1, 2 AS N$, 12 AS B$...
GET #1     'GET does not need a position or variable with successive FIELD buffer reads
Y = CVI(N$)
```
