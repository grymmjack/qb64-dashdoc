#### SYNTAX

`I've made a few minor changes to the program. It will show you the first 400 bytes when you choose to export the data. Also, by moving the initialization of sc and so outside the loop, you will now come back to the correct entry upon ascending a level. I experimented with code to PSET the data, but it is commented out.`
