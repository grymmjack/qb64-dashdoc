In legacy versions such as [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic "wikipedia:QBasic") / [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC "wikipedia:QuickBASIC") the **DECLARE** keyword was used in the beginning of a program to declare the subroutines and functions used/defined in that program. Although this practice is still supported for compatibility with old code, it is no longer required in QB64, but instead it is used here to open a Library function block.
