A \_BYTE variable can hold signed variable values from -128 to 127 (one byte or 8 [\_BITs](/qb64wiki/index.php/BIT "BIT")). [Unsigned](/qb64wiki/index.php/UNSIGNED "UNSIGNED") from 0 to 255.

## Syntax


[DIM](/qb64wiki/index.php/DIM "DIM") *byte* [AS](/qb64wiki/index.php/AS "AS") [[[\_UNSIGNED] \_BYTE
  




## Description


* Signed \_BYTE values can range from -128 to 127.
* [\_UNSIGNED](/qb64wiki/index.php/UNSIGNED "UNSIGNED") \_BYTEs can hold values from 0 to 255. [\_UNSIGNED](/qb64wiki/index.php/UNSIGNED "UNSIGNED") expands the range of positive values.
* Can be defined in a **QB64** [\_DEFINE](/qb64wiki/index.php/DEFINE "DEFINE") statement using a starting letter range of variable names.
* Also can be used in a subroutine parameter [AS](/qb64wiki/index.php/AS "AS") \_BYTE variable definitions.
* Define a byte using the suffixÂ %% after the variable name: *variable%%* = -54
* Define an unsigned byte by adding the suffix ~%% after the variable name: variable~%% = 54
* **When a variable has not been assigned or has no type suffix, the value defaults to [SINGLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SINGLE "SINGLE").**


  




**[BITS](/qb64wiki/index.php/BIT "BIT")**
* The **MSB** is the most significant(largest) bit value and **LSB** is the least significant bit of a binary or register memory address value. The order in which the bits are read determines the binary or decimal byte value. There are two common ways to read a byte:


* **"Big-endian"**: MSB is the first bit encountered, decreasing to the LSB as the last bit by position, memory address or time.
* **"Little-endian"**: LSB is the first bit encountered, increasing to the MSB as the last bit by position, memory address or time.

The big-endian method compares exponents of 2 ^ 7 down to 2 ^ 0 while the little-endian method does the opposite.
  




**BYTES**
* [INTEGER](/qb64wiki/index.php/INTEGER "INTEGER") values consist of 2 bytes called the **HI** and **LO** bytes. Anytime that the number of binary digits is a multiple of 16 (2bytes, 4 bytes, etc.) and the HI byte's MSB is on(1), the value returned will be negative. Even with [SINGLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/SINGLE "SINGLE") or [DOUBLE](/qb64wiki/index.php/DOUBLE "DOUBLE") values!




| ```                                  **16 BIT INTEGER OR REGISTER**               **AH (High Byte Bits)                         AL (Low Byte Bits)**    BIT:    15    14   13   12   11   10   9   8  |   7   6    5   4    3    2   1    0           ---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------    HEX:   8000  4000 2000 1000  800 400  200 100 |  80   40  20   10   8    4   2    1  ``` | DEC: -32768 16384 8192 4096 2048 1024 512 256 | 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 |

The HI byte's **MSB** is often called the **sign** bit! When all 16 of the integer binary bits are on, the decimal return is -1.
  




## Examples


How negative assignments affect the \_UNSIGNED value returned by a byte (8 bits).
